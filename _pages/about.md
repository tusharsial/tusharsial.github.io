I am an incoming MS in Aerospace Engineering student at Iowa State University. Digging deep into the multifaceted aspects throughout my undergraduate journey, I’ve identified my interest in advancing control theory for nonlinear dynamical systems such as robots and spacecraft. Starting in Fall 2024, I'll pursue a Research Assistantship under Professor [Abhishek Halder](https://abhishekhalder.org/index.html).

Apart from this, I also keep a keen interest in the domain of Electric vehicles. My hobbies include playing the keyboard, cricket and badminton, running, and cycling.

With a growing debris population, robots that can perform routine tasks autonomously (such as simple repairs/maintenance, refueling, or debris removal) may become increasingly essential for actively preventing disaster. In this context, several autonomous missions to uncooperative targets will require rendezvous and docking procedures. I interned in the Aerospace Department at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, under the guidance of Professor [Debasish Ghose](https://aero.iisc.ac.in/people/debasish-ghose/), where I developed control algorithms for **Autonomous Docking & Rendezvous (AR&D)** of spacecraft with non-cooperative tumbling satellites.

Professional Experience

I worked as a **DevSecOps** (Development, Security, & Operations) Engineer at the Digital Factory Vertical of the IT Team at HDFC Bank, Bengaluru. My primary tasks involved Designing, maintaining & securing **CI/CD pipelines** using Jenkins, Git, Kubernetes, and Docker. In addition to this, I was also tasked with implementing **infrastructure-as-code (IAC) principles** using tools like Terraform and Ansible, ensuring secure and compliant cloud environments.

I am a 2nd-year Master's student in Aerospace Engineering at Iowa State University. Since the fall of 2024, I've been working as a Graduate Research Assistant under Professor [Abhishek Halder](https://abhishekhalder.org/index.html), at the intersection of Stochastic Systems, Dynamics & Control, and Optimization. My enduring curiosity for Control Systems led me to major in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS) Pilani. My undergraduate and master's research experiences have helped me identify my interests in bridging astrodynamics, control theory, optimization, and stochastic systems to advance the Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) architectures of space systems, enabling autonomous decision-making in uncertain multi-body environments.

Apart from this, I also keep a keen interest in Electric vehicles. My hobbies include trekking, cricket, badminton, running, and cycling.

I'm researching the intersection of Stochastic Systems, Dynamics & Control, and Optimization under Professor Abhishek Halder. The current project that I'm working on involves designing an Optimal Covariance Steering Algorithm for a Stochastic System over a finite time horizon. In addition, I'm contributing to the design and testing of generative profiling algorithms for adaptive resource allocation and scheduling on single- and multicore real-time embedded systems. This project was in collaboration between researchers from the University of California, Santa Cruz, Iowa State University, and the University of Pennsylvania.

With a growing debris population in low Earth orbit, robots performing routine tasks autonomously (such as simple repairs/maintenance, refueling, or debris removal) may become increasingly essential for actively preventing disasters. Several missions to uncooperative targets will require **Autonomous Rendezvous and Docking (AR&D)** operations. I interned in the Aerospace Department at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, under the guidance of Professor [Debasish Ghose](https://sites.google.com/view/gcdsl-iisc/home), where I developed control algorithms for **AR&D** of spacecraft with non-cooperative tumbling satellites.

Professional Experience

I worked as a **DevSecOps** (Development, Security, & Operations) Engineer in the Digital Factory Vertical of the IT Team at HDFC Bank, Bengaluru. My primary tasks involved designing, maintaining & securing **CI/CD pipelines** using Jenkins, Git, Kubernetes, and Docker. In addition, I was tasked with implementing **infrastructure-as-code (IAC) principles** using tools such as Terraform and Ansible, ensuring secure, compliant cloud environments.

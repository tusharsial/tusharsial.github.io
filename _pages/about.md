I am an Aerospace Engineering Masters student at Iowa State University. My enduring curiosity for Control Systems led me to major in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at BITS Pilani. Digging deep into its multifaceted aspects throughout my undergraduate journey, I’ve identified my interest in advancing control theory for nonlinear dynamical systems such as robots and spacecraft. Starting in the Fall of 2024, I've been a Research Assist under Professor [Abhishek Halder](https://abhishekhalder.org/index.html), where I've been conducting research at the intersection of Stochastic Systems, Dynamics & Control, and Optimization.

Apart from this, I also keep a keen interest in Electric vehicles. My hobbies include playing the keyboard, cricket and badminton, running, and cycling.

I'm researching the intersection of Stochastic Systems, Dynamics & Control, and Optimization under Professor Abhishek Halder. The current project that I'm working on involves designing an Optimal Covariance Steering Algorithm for a Stochastic System over a finite time horizon. In addition to this, I'm contributing to the design and testing of generative profiling algorithms for adaptive resource allocation and scheduling tasks on single and multicore real-time embedded systems. This project was in collaboration between researchers from the University of California Santa Cruz, Iowa State University, and the University of Pennsylvania.

With a growing debris population in the lower Earth orbit, robots performing routine tasks autonomously (such as simple repairs/maintenance, refueling, or debris removal) may become increasingly essential for actively preventing disaster. Several missions to uncooperative targets will require **Autonomous Rendezvous and Docking (AR&D)** operations. I interned in the Aerospace Department at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, under the guidance of Professor [Debasish Ghose](https://aero.iisc.ac.in/people/debasish-ghose/), where I developed control algorithms for **AR&D** of spacecraft with non-cooperative tumbling satellites.

I worked as a **DevSecOps** (Development, Security, & Operations) Engineer at the Digital Factory Vertical of the IT Team at HDFC Bank, Bengaluru. My primary tasks involved designing, maintaining & securing **CI/CD pipelines** using Jenkins, Git, Kubernetes, and Docker. In addition to this, I was also tasked with implementing **infrastructure-as-code (IAC) principles** using tools like Terraform and Ansible, ensuring secure and compliant cloud environments.

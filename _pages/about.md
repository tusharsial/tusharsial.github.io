I am an incoming MS in Aerospace Engineering student at Iowa State University. Digging deep into the multifaceted aspects throughout my undergraduate journey, Iâ€™ve identified my interest in advancing control theory for nonlinear dynamical systems such as robots and spacecraft. Starting in Fall 2024, I'll pursue a Research Assistantship under Professor [Abhishek Halder](https://abhishekhalder.org/index.html).

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

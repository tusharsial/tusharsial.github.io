Flight Stabilizing Controllers for Agile Fixed-Wing UAV
------
![Fixed Drone Photo](/images/Fixed Drone.jpeg){: .align-right width="240px"}
In this project, I've designed **flight stability controllers** for an agile fixed-wing UAV under Professor Bijoy Krishna Mukherjee, Department of EEE at BITS Pilani. In particular, I designed and modeled the Longitudinal and Lateral-Directional stability movement controllers of the UAV using the **Backstepping Control technique** using MATLAB and Simulink. Additionally, I created a **wind observer** to incorporate environmental disturbances(like wind shears, wind gusts, and atmospheric disturbances) to make the controllers robust and, thus, improve flight capability. The code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/tusharsial/Agile-Fixed-Wing-UAV).

Autonomous Mars Rover

In 2020, I co-founded **CRISS Robotics**, a student research technical team for designing and manufacturing an all-terrain 6-wheeled Autonomous Mars rover. I developed the **high-level electrical architecture** and an **electronic differential-based drive control system** for the Rover there, capable of Autonomous traversal, Equipment servicing using a 6-DOF Robotic Manipulator, and life detection using a Science module. CRISS qualified for the International Rover Challenge in the 2022 finals at Chennai among 16 international teams, then won the **International Rover Design Challenge** in 2023.

In 2020, I co-founded CRISS Robotics, a student research technical team for designing and manufacturing an Autonomous Mars rover. I developed the high-level electrical architecture and an electronic differential-based drive control system for the 6-wheeled Rover there. CRISS qualified for the International Rover Challenge in 2022 finals at Chennai among 16 international teams, followed by winning the International Rover Design Challenge in 2023.

Autonomous Mars Rover

In 2020, I co-founded CRISS Robotics, a student research technical team for designing and manufacturing an Autonomous Mars rover. I developed the high-level electrical architecture and an electronic differential-based drive control system for the 6-wheeled Rover there. CRISS qualified for the International Rover Challenge in the 2022 finals at Chennai among 16 international teams, then won the International Rover Design Challenge in 2023.

Flight Stabilizing Controllers for Agile Fixed-Wing UAV

In this project, I've designed flight stability controllers for an agile fixed-wing UAV using the Backstepping approach under Professor Bijoy Krishna Mukherjee, Department of EEE at BITS Pilani. In particular, I designed and modeled the Longitudinal and Lateral-Directional stability movement controllers of the UAV using
the Backstepping Control technique using MATLAB and Simulink. Additionally, I designed a wind observer to incorporate environmental disturbances(like wind shears, wind gusts, and atmospheric disturbances) to make the controllers robust and, thus, improve flight capability.
